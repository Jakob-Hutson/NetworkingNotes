In line sensor:
  Placed between communicating devices to stop attacks
    IPS
    Impacts network latency
Passive Sensors:
  Monitors network segments
  Can detect attacks but cannot stop them
  Gets copies of Network traffic
    IDS
  Does not impact network latency
Tap:
  Appliance placed between two network devices
  Best for packet collection without data loss
  Not scalable
  Will need several installed to capture traffic for other network segments
MITM:
  Attacker can use arp or some other method/protocol
  Attackers can sniff or manipulate traffic that flows through them
  Typically must be on the same network as the victim
  Traffic capture is dependent on the attackers system and bandwidth
SPAN:
  Configured on the network switch
  Best for packet collection of traffic from several switch ports at once
  Can have a high degree of packet loss
  Places burden on the network switch
  Scalable
