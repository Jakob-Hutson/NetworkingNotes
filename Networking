In line sensor:
  Placed between communicating devices to stop attacks
    IPS
    Impacts network latency
Passive Sensors:
  Monitors network segments
  Can detect attacks but cannot stop them
  Gets copies of Network traffic
    IDS
  Does not impact network latency
Tap:
  Appliance placed between two network devices
  Best for packet collection without data loss
  Not scalable
  Will need several installed to capture traffic for other network segments
MITM:
  Attacker can use arp or some other method/protocol
  Attackers can sniff or manipulate traffic that flows through them
  Typically must be on the same network as the victim
  Traffic capture is dependent on the attackers system and bandwidth
SPAN:
  Configured on the network switch
  Best for packet collection of traffic from several switch ports at once
  Can have a high degree of packet loss
  Places burden on the network switch
  Scalable
Fingerprinting and Host Identification
 Variances in the RFX implementation for different OS's and systems enables the capability for fingerprinting
  Tools can be used for fingerprinting and host identification
Fingerprinting
  Active OS fingerprinting
    Easier
    Send packets to the target and monitor response
    Tools: Nmap, Xprobe, sinfb3
  Passive OS fingerprinting
    More difficult
    Rely on sniffing packets
      Tools: p0f, Ettercap, PRADS
Open ports and protocols
  Known Windows Ports
  88 - Kerberos
  137/138/139 - NetBIOS
  445 SMB
  Known linux ports
  22 - SSH
  111 - SunRPC
Protocol Specific Identifiers
  HTTP - User agent strings
  SSH - Initial connection
  NetBIOS - Name service
P0F
  Looks at variations in the TTL, Fragementation flag, default IP header packet length, window size, and TCP options
  Configuration stored in: /etc/p0f/p0f.fp
Baselining:
  Snapshot of what the network looks like during a time frame, No industry standard, 7 days to establish the inital snapshot, Prerequisite information
Network Baseline
  Determines the current state of your network
  Ascertain the current utilization of network resources
  Identify normal vs. peak traffic time frames
  Verify port/protocol usage
Perform Baselining:
  Networking Diagram
  Known severs hosts and networking devices
  Known ips, ports and protocols
  Known forbidden IPs ports and protocols

  What traffic/protocols to capture
  Which network segments
  Which days
  What times
